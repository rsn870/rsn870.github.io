In the spirit of the Giants here's an announcement :

print('Hello World')


I am Sai Niranjan currently an undergrad at the Indian Institute Of Science Bangalore . I would like to use this site as a 
forum where I can share the work that I have done ,ideas that I have implemented  and resources that I have used ,  all in the hope of doing some public good !

Here's to a pleasant journey ahead that will hopefully last for many moons !

Cheers
