Welcome. I am a first-principles researcher and PhD candidate at the Technical University of Munich, specializing in understanding the emergence of structure in complex systems. My work focuses on finding non-obvious connections between different theoretical domains, such as statistical physics, economics and machine learning, to build novel insights. I am driven to translate these foundational discoveries into practical, high-impact applications and robust, engineerable systems.

My research journey is driven by a passion for bridging the gap between academic theory and real-world impact. This has led me to roles in strategic consulting and venture capital, where I engaged with key operational and managerial challenges. Currently, I am also a part of Stone Buck Labs, where we leverage insights into the structure of complex data to engineer robust, high-performance tools for large-scale data challenges.

This website serves as a portfolio of my work. Please feel free to explore my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V60DwW4AAAAJ), [invited talks](/talks/), and past projects. I am always open to discussing new ideas.
