An interesting saying by Sir Francis Bacon goes like this 'Some books should be tasted, some devoured, but only a few should be chewed and digested thoroughly.'
On that note here are some interesting references I feel worthy of being digested :

# Math

# Computer Science

# Strange Tales

# Stranger Tales

# Bedside Reading 






Thanks for reading!
